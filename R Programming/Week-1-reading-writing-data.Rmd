Reading and Writing Data
=============================

Reading Data
-------------

There are a few principal functions reading data into R.

* read.table, read.csv, for reading tabular data
* readLines, for reading lines of a text file
* source, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
* dget, for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
* load, for reading in saved workspaces
* unserialize, for reading single R objects in binary form

Writing Data
-------------

There are analogous functions for writing data to files

* write.table
* writeLines
* dump
* dput
* save
* serialize

Reading Data Files with read.table
-------------------------------------

The read.table function is one of the most commonly used functions for reading data. It has a few important arguments:

* file, the name of a file, or a connection
* header, logical indicating if the file has a header line
* sep, a string indicating how the columns are separated
* colClasses, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset
* nrows, the number of rows in the dataset
* comment.char, a character string indicating the comment character
* skip, the number of lines to skip from the beginning
* stringsAsFactors, should character variables be coded as factors?

read.table
--------------

For small to moderately sized datasets, you can usually call read.table without specifying any other arguments.

```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
data <- read.table("foo.txt")
```

R will automatically

* skip lines that begin with a#
* figure out how many rows there are (and how much memory needs to be allocated)
* figure what type of variable is in each column of the table Telling R all these things directly makes
* R run faster and more efficiently.
* read.csv is identical to read.table except that the default separator is a comma.

Reading in Larger Datasets with read.table
------------------------------------------

With much larger datasets, doing the following things will make your life easier and will prevent R from choking.

* Read the help page for read.table, which contains many hints
* Make a rough calculation of the memory required to store your datasets. If the dataset is larger than the amount of RAM on your computer, you can probably stop right here.
* Set comment.char = "" if there are no commented lines in your file


Reading in Larger Datasets with read.table
------------------------------------------

* Use the colClasses argument. It can make read.table up to twice as fast since it doesn't have to guess what datatypes to make your fields.  In order to use this option, you have to know the class of each column in your data frame. If all of the columns are “numeric”, for example, then you can just set colClasses = "numeric". A quick an dirty way to figure out the classes of each column is the following:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrows = 100)
classes <- sapply(initial, class)
tabAll <- read.table("datatable.txt",
                     colClasses = classes)
```

* Set nrows. This doesn't make R run faster but it helps with memory usage. A mild overestimate is okay. You can use the Unix tool wc to calculate the number of lines in a file.

Textual Formats
---------------

* dumping and dputing are useful because the resulting textual format is editable, and in the case of corruption, potentially recoverable
* Unlink writing out a table or CSV file, dump and dput preserve the metadata (sacrificing some readability), so that another user doesn't have to specify it all over again
* Textual formats can work much better with version control programs like subversion and git which can only track changes meaningfully in text files
* Textual formats can be longer-lived; if there is corruption somewhere in the file, it can be easier to fix the problem
* Textual formats adhere to the "Unix philosophy"
* Downside: the format is not very space efficient


dput-ting R Objects
-------------------

Another way to pass data around is by deparsing the R object with dput and reading back using dget.

```{r}
y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a"); dput(y)
dput(y, file = "Week-1-y.R")
new.y <- dget("Week-1-y.R"); new.y
```

Dumping R Objects
-----------------

Multiple objects can be deparsed using the dump function and read back in using source.

```{r}
x <- "foo"
y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
dump(c("x", "y"), file = "Week-1-data.R")
rm(x, y)
source("Week-1-data.R")
y
x
```

Interfaces to the Outside World
-------------------------------

Data are read in using connection interfaces. Connections can be made to files (most common) or to other more exotic things.

* file, opens a connection to a file
* gzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with gzip
* bzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with bzip2
* url, opens a connection to a webpage

File Connections
----------------
```{r}
str(file)
```

* description is the name of the file
* open is a code indicating
	* "r" read only
	* "w" writing (and initializing a new file)
	* "a" appending
	* "rb", "wb", "ab" reading, writing, or appending in binary mode (Windows)

Connections
---------------

In general, connections are powerful tools that let you navigate files or other external objects. In practice, we often don't need to deal with the connection interface directly.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
con <- file("foo.txt", r)
data <- read.csv(con)
close(con)
```

Is the same as:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("foo.txt")
```

Reading Lines of a Text File
----------------------------

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
con <- gzfile("words.gz")
x <- readLines(con, 10); x
# [1] "1080"     "10-point" "10th"     "11-point"
#	[5] "12-point" "16-point" "18-point" "1st"
#	[9]	"2"        "20-point" ""
```

writeLines takes a character vector and writes each element one line at a time to a text file.

readLines can be useful for reading in lines of webpages.

```{r}
## This might take time
con <- url("http://www.jhsph.edu", "r")
x <- readLines(con)
head(x)
```
