Vectors
-------

Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An
atomic vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain
multiple data types.

logical vectors in action:

``` r
num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)
tf <- num_vect < 1; tf
```

    ## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

``` r
num_vect >= 6
```

    ## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

character vectors in action:

``` r
my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")
paste(my_char, collapse = " ") # Joins the my_char together separated by spaces
```

    ## [1] "My name is"

``` r
my_name <-c(my_char, "Kyle") # concatenates my name and my_char
paste(my_name, collapse = " ")
```

    ## [1] "My name is Kyle"

``` r
paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
```

    ## [1] "Hello world!"

``` r
paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")
```

    ## [1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

``` r
paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
```

    ##  [1] "A-1" "B-2" "C-3" "D-4" "E-1" "F-2" "G-3" "H-4" "I-1" "J-2" "K-3" "L-4"
    ## [13] "M-1" "N-2" "O-3" "P-4" "Q-1" "R-2" "S-3" "T-4" "U-1" "V-2" "W-3" "X-4"
    ## [25] "Y-1" "Z-2"

Missing Values
--------------

Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis.
Often, missing values must not be ignored, but rather they should be
carefully studied to see if thereâ€™s an underlying pattern or cause for
their missingness.

Here is an example:

``` r
x <- c(44, NA, 5, NA)
x * 3
```

    ## [1] 132  NA  15  NA

``` r
y <- rnorm(1000) # 1000 draws from a standard normal distribution
z <- rep(NA, 1000)
my_data <- sample(c(y,z), 100) # let's select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values (combining y and z) such that we don't know how many NAs we'll wind up with or what positions they'll occupy in our final vector

my_na <- is.na(my_data)
sum(my_na) # Since FALSE (numerical) is 0 and TRUE (NA) is 1, by adding up my_na can we determine the number of NAs
```

    ## [1] 50
